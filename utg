local Player = game.Players.LocalPlayer

Player.Chatted:connect(function(cht)
	if cht:match("/open UTG") then
		loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://pastebin.com/raw/NhRrqGgy", true))() -- make sure you add in the script too
	elseif cht:match(";admin") then -- add what you want to say for the script to execute so i put "admin" because i want it to load an admin script
		loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://pastebin.com/raw/iM2Hhq68", true))()
	end
end)

-- now we're going to add a simple script that lets us know when the script is working

game:GetService("StarterGui"):SetCore("SendNotification",{
    Title = "Loaded UTG";
    Text = "say /open UTG on the chat for UTG appear";
})

-- this script will give you a pop up notification for when ever you load the script

-- im also going to show you how to convert normal scripts into pastebin links

-- lets get back to testing the script

-- make sure you copy the whole scriot (Control A) than copy it (Control C) than paste it into your executor like im going to show (COntrol V to Paste)

-- as you can see, its working perfectly 

-- now we're going to cover adding multiple script to your admin script

-- as you can see from inside the synapse executor some times you get scripts that are just way to big to put into an executor
-- im now going to show you how to convert those big scripts into a loadstring which will compact the script. it's very simple'

-- loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://pastebin.com/raw/iM2Hhq68", true))() -- now you're going to need a already made pastebin link to do this
--  i will add this loadstring link in the description so you can use it when you're making yours'
-- all you're going to need to do is replace the url of the old one with the url of the new one you made'
-- as im going to show
-- now all you're going to do is just copy the whole link and put it into the script '
	

-- this is going to be a good shit.

-- For open the Gui you need say /open UTG for it opens :)
